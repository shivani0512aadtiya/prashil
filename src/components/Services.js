          <h3>Healthful Edible Oils</h3>
          <p className="p-text">
            Healthful edible oils are nutrient-rich oils derived from plants,
            prized for their numerous health benefits. Examples include olive,
            coconut, avocado, and sunflower oils, each offering a unique profile
            of essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins. These oils

            boost overall well-being. Healthful edible oils are versatile in the
            kitchen, suitable for cooking, baking, and salad dressings. Their
            high smoke points and pleasant flavors make them ideal for a variety
            of culinary applications. Incorporating these oils into your diet

          <h3>Cold-pressed</h3>
          <p className="p-text">
            Cold-pressed oils are extracted from seeds or fruits without using
            heat, preserving their natural nutrients and flavors. This method
            ensures oils retain essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and
            vitamins, offering significant health benefits. Popular cold-pressed
            oils include olive, coconut, and sesame, each known for its unique
            nutritional profile. These oils are ideal for cooking, baking, and
            dressings due to their rich taste and high quality. Cold-pressed
            oils support heart health, improve digestion, and enhance skin
            health. They are also free from harmful chemicals and additives.
            Incorporating cold-pressed oils into your diet promotes a natural
            and healthy lifestyle.
